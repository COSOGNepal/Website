Based in Kathmandu, Nepal, we are dedicated to revolutionizing computer science education throughout the country. Our primary focus is enabling students to initiate and manage Computer Science clubs in secondary and high schools across remote areas, creating a vibrant community of young tech enthusiasts.`]} />
                    <Descriptor title="Our story" descriptions={["Cosog Nepal's journey was rooted in a transformative observation by Bibek, our president, during his tenure as a STEM instructor. The recent expansion of the Nepalese high school system from 11th-12th to 9th-12th grades opened new doors for younger students, yet many remained unaware of these burgeoning opportunities, especially in technology. Bibek identified a critical void in high schools: the absence of a Computer Science club culture from grade 9 onwards. This gap deprived students of valuable experiences like engaging with cutting-edge technologies, participating in hackathons, and competing in Olympiads â€“ opportunities essential for cultivating tech-savvy and competitive individuals."]} />
